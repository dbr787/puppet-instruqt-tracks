description: |-
  In this lab you will:
  - Create a dedicated code deployment user you will use to authenticate to deploy code.
  - Configure Code Manager to authenticate and download your control-repo from the git server.
  - Create a feature branch in your control-repo from main to allow you to develop safely without affecting production.
  - Add module in your Puppetfile on your feature branch to test a code deployment
  - Deploy code from your feature branch to the primary server to enable you to later test changes on nodes in a separate puppet environment.I
