  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll install the Puppet agent using two different methods: locally using installation script and remotely from the PE console. Both methods enable you to install agents at scale.

  Installing agents at scale prepares your infrastructure to quickly and automatically scale up the number of nodes managed and configured as Puppet manifests are written and deployed to the primary Puppet server.


  **Prerequisites**

  None

      In this lab, you will:

      * Install an agent locally on a node by using the installation script.
      * Install an agent remotely on a node by using the PE console.
      * For both methods, sign the new agent certificate by using the console.


      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: "<a name=\"linux\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/install-local-linux.png\"></a>\n\n## Run the agent installation script from the node’s command line.\n\n1. Log into the PE console with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.\n\n1. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page.\n\n1. In the upper-right corner, click **Add Nodes**.\n\n1. On the **Add nodes to inventory** page, click **Install Agents**.\n\n1. Copy the curl command shown in the ***nix nodes** field at the right of the console.<br><br>\U0001F4A1 **Tip:** Select the text and right-click to copy.\n\n1. ![swtich tabs](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Instruct%20Icons/icon_switch_tabs_white_32.png) Switch to the **Linux Agent** tab. Then, paste and run the curl command.<br><br>✔️ **Result:** This command installs the Puppet agent.\n\n1. ![swtich tabs](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Instruct%20Icons/icon_switch_tabs_white_32.png) Switch back to the **PE Console** tab when the installation is complete.\n\n1. Click **Refresh** at the top right of the console.\n\n1. Now you have to sign the agent's certificate. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Certificates** page and click the **Unsigned certificates** tab.\n\n1. On the list of nodes, find the `nixagent` node and click **Accept**.\n\n1. ![swtich tabs](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Instruct%20Icons/icon_switch_tabs_white_32.png) Switch back to the **Linux Agent** tab.\n\n1.

From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page. Click the `nixagent` node.\n\n1. On the **Facts** tab, inspect the facts about the `nixagent` node.\n\n<br>\U0001F388 **Congratulations!**  You installed Puppet agents locally from the command line on Linux.

In the upper-right corner of the console, click **Add Nodes**.\n\n3. On the **Add nodes to inventory** page, click **Install Agents**.\n\n4. From the **Transport method** list, select **WinRM**. Enter the following information:\n\n     - WinRM hosts: `winagent`\n     - User: `Administrator`\n     - password: `Puppetlabs!`\n\n5. Click **Add nodes**.<br><br>✏️ **Note:** The installation might take a few minutes to complete.\n\n6. To check the status of the installation, navigate to **Tasks** page, and then click the ID number of the **pe_bootstrap** task. When the installation is complete, you'll see a certname in the output at the bottom of the page.\n\n7. When the certificate is ready to sign, a blue notification will appear on the **Certificates** page link.<br><br>\U0001F4A1 **Tip:** If the notification doesn't appear after the `pe_bootstrap` task has finished running, click the refresh icon at the top right of the PE console.\n\n8. Now sign the agent's certificate. Navigate to the **Certificates** page and then click the **Unsigned certificates** tab.\n\n9.
