      In this lab, you'll complete an express installation of PE and confirm in the PE console that the installation was successful.

       Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: |-
    1. On the **Primary Server** tab, download the installation tarball:
    Tip: Click the code block to copy it, and then right-click and paste it on the command line.
    ```
    curl -JLO 'https://pm.puppet.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi?dist=el&rel=7&arch=x86_64&ver=2019.8.6'
    ```

    2. Unpack the tarball:
    ```
    tar -xf puppet-enterprise-2019.8.6-el-7-x86_64.tar.gz
    ```
    3. Run the Puppet Enterprise installer. When prompted, enter **Y** to proceed:
    ```
    ./puppet-enterprise-2019.8.6-el-7-x86_64/puppet-enterprise-installer
    ```
    ✏️ Note: This step might take a few minutes to complete.

    4. Set the password for the PE console to **puppetlabs** (you will use this password to log into the console after PE is installed):
    ```
    puppet infrastructure console_password --password=puppetlabs
    ```
    5. Run Puppet <b>twice</b> to complete the PE installation (don't chain the commands):
    ```
    puppet agent -t
    ```
    ✏️ Note: Running Puppet twice ensures that all of the post-configuration operations are complete and that PE is running.

    6. Check the status of the Puppet services:
    ```
    puppet infrastructure status
    ```

    7. Switch to the **PE Console** tab.

    8. Log into the console with ID `admin` and password `puppetlabs` (the password you set in Step 4).

    9. On the **Status** page, click **Puppet Services status** near the top right. You should see output similar to the following:

    ![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE-deploy-and-discover/1.0.pe-deploy-and-discover-status.png)
    10. Make sure that all the services in the list are running ("operational").

    Congratulations! You installed PE, and its basic configuration is now complete.
