  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll learn how to configure the primary Puppet server to provide the packages needed to install agents on different operating systems, making agent deployment faster and easier across your infrastructure.


  **Prerequisites**

  None

  **Keep an eye on the clock**

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  Click **Start track** when you're ready to begin.

  teaser: Add agent packages for the platforms in your infrastructure.

      In this lab, you will:

      1. Attempt an agent installation on a node with a different OS than the primary server.
      2. Configure the primary server to provide OS-specific agent packages so that you can install agents across a variety of nodes.
      3. Attempt the agent installation again and autosign the agent certificate by providing a challenge password.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: "1. On the Linux node, install an agent by running the installation script with the `custom_attributes:challengePassword` parameter:<br><br>\n    ```\n    uri='https://puppet:8140/packages/current/install.bash'\n    curl --insecure \"$uri\" | bash -s custom_attributes:challengePassword=PASSWORD_FOR_AUTOSIGNER_SCRIPT\n    ```\n    ✔️ **Result:** The installation script will fail.\n\n2. In the output, notice the failure message:<br><br>\n    ```\n    The agent packages needed to support el-8-x86_64 are not present on your primary server.\n    To add them, apply the pe_repo::platform::el_8_x86_64 class to your master node, and then run Puppet.\n    The required agent packages should be retrieved when puppet runs on the master, after which you can run the install.bash script again.\n    ```\n\n    \U0001F4AD **Why did the installation fail?**<br>\n    The EL8 package isn't present on the primary server — the primary server isn't running EL8. To ensure that the packages are present, you must add the `pe_repo::platform:<AGENT_OS_VERSION_ARCHITECTURE>` classes to the primary server.\n\n3. ![swtich tabs](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Instruct%20Icons/icon_switch_tabs_white_32.png) Switch to the **PE Console** tab.<br><br>Log in with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.\n\n1. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Node groups** page. Expand **PE Infrastructure** (click **+**) and then click **PE Master**.\n\n1. Add the repository class for the agent node OS that you want to support.\n    1. On the **Classes** tab, in the **Add new class** field, enter `pe_repo`.\n    2. From the list of classes, select the `pe_repo::platform::el_8_x86_64` repo class.\n    3. Click **Add class**.\n\n1. Commit your change: Click **Commit** in the bottom right of the page.\n\n1. ![swtich tabs](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Instruct%20Icons/icon_switch_tabs_white_32.png) Switch to the **Primary Server** tab.\n\n1. Run Puppet to manually trigger the download of the new agent package to the primary server:<br><br>\n    ```\n    puppet agent -t\n    ```\n\n8. ![swtich tabs](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Instruct%20Icons/icon_switch_tabs_white_32.png) Switch to the **Linux Agent** tab.\n\n1. Install the agent on the Linux node by running the following installation script, which includes the `custom_attributes:challengePassword` parameter to autosign the agent certificate:<br><br>\n    ```\n    uri='https://puppet:8140/packages/current/install.bash'\n    curl --insecure \"$uri\" | sudo bash -s custom_attributes:challengePassword=PASSWORD_FOR_AUTOSIGNER_SCRIPT\n    ```\n    In the output, notice the success message. (You may need to scroll up).\n    ```\n    Installed:\n      puppet-agent-6.22.1-1.el8.x86_64\n\n    Complete!\n    ```\n\n<br>\U0001F388 **Congratulations!** You configured PE to support installing agents that run a different OS than the primary server.\n\n---\n\n**Find any bugs or have feedback?
