  **Keep an eye on the clock**

  ![10 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/10min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 10 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  Click **Start track** when you're ready to begin.
