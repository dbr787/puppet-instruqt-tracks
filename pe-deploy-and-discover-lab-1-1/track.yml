title: Configure User Access
teaser: Learn how to assign role-based access in Puppet Enterprise.
description: |-
  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll learn how to manage users and roles in Puppet Enterprise (PE) so that you can control what tasks users can do within PE. Assigning users to roles — or role-based access control (RBAC) — is more efficient than managing permissions for individual users.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

  **Keep an eye on the clock**
