  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab you'll learn how to enable the package data collection feature via the PE console in order to discover which packages are installed across your systems. Then, you will use this information to identify the different server roles within your environment.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

  **Before you start**

  Keep an eye on the clock. You have 30 minutes to complete this lab. After 30 minutes, your learning environment expires and your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it. Click Start track when you're ready to begin.

      Your objective is to enable continuous auditing and compliance across the systems in your environment:

      1. Ensure visibility of all currently installed packages and versions.
      2. Identify each server's role in your environment.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: |-
    Package data collection is disabled by default, so the Packages page in the PE console initially appears blank. In order to view a node's current package inventory, you must **enable** package data collection.

    You can choose to collect package data on all your nodes or just a subset. Any node with an agent version 1.6.0 or later installed can report package data, including nodes that are not under active management with PE.

    # Enable package data collection.
    1. In the console, click **Node groups**.

    2. To collect package data on your nodes, click the **PE Agent** node group.

    3. Click **Classes** and locate the `puppet_enterprise::profile::agent` in the list.

    4. In the `puppet_enterprise::profile::agent` class, set the **Parameter** selection to `package_inventory_enabled` and the **Value** to `true`. Click **Add parameter** and commit your changes.

    5. Run Puppet to apply these changes to the nodes in the **PE Agent** node group.

    6. Puppet enables package inventory collection on this Puppet run and begins collecting package data and reporting it on the **Packages** page on each subsequent Puppet run.

    7. Run Puppet a second time to begin collecting package data, and then click **Packages**.

    # View and manage package inventory.

    1. To view and manage the complete inventory of packages on your systems, view the **Packages** page in the console.

    2. Run Puppet to collect the latest package data from your nodes.

    3. Search for packages: In the console, click **Packages** to view your package inventory. To narrow the list of packages, enter the name or partial name of a package in the **Filter by package name** field and click **Apply**.

    4. Enter the following package names one at a time:
        **java-latest-openjdk**, **httpd**, **nginx**

    If a node is found with one of the above packages, you can now start to identify the node's role:

    | Package name        | Server role   |
    |---------------------|---------------|
    | java-latest-openjdk | App server    |
    | httpd               | Web server    |
    | nginx               | Load balancer |

    Congratulations! You ensured the visibility of all currently installed packages and versions. Some of the other students will have different packages across their servers in their lab environment - this is expected!
