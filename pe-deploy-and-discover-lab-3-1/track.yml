  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab you'll learn how to enable the package data collection feature via the PE console in order to discover which packages are installed across your systems. Then, you will use this information to identify the different server roles within your environment.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

  **Before you start**

  Keep an eye on the clock. You have 30 minutes to complete this lab. After 30 minutes, your learning environment expires and your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it. Click Start track when you're ready to begin.

      Your objective is to enable continuous auditing and compliance across the systems in your environment:

      1. Ensure visibility of all currently installed packages and versions.
      2. Identify each server's role in your environment.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: |-
    Package data collection is disabled by default, so the Packages page in the PE console initially appears blank. In order to view a node's current package inventory, you must **enable** package data collection.

    You can choose to collect package data on all your nodes or just a subset. Any node with an agent version 1.6.0 or later installed can report package data, including nodes that are not under active management with PE.

    # Enable package data collection:
    1. On the **PE Console** tab, log into the console with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.

    2. Go to the **Node groups** page, expand (click **+**) **PE Infrastructure**, and click the **PE Agent** node group.

    3. On the **Classes** tab, notice that the `puppet_enterprise::profile::agent` class has already been added to this node group, along with a couple of class-specific parameters.

    4. In the **Parameter name** list for the class, select the `package_inventory_enabled` parameter and set its value to `true`. Then, click **Add to node group** and commit your changes by clicking **Commit** near the bottom of the page.

    5. Run Puppet to apply these changes to the nodes in the **PE Agent** node group: Click **Run** near the upper-right corner the page.

    On this Puppet run, Puppet enables package inventory collection. On subsequent Puppet runs, Puppet collects package data and reports it on the **Packages** page.

    6. To start collecting and reporting package data, run Puppet a second time by clicking **Run job** near the bottom of the page. This might take a few moments to complete.

    Tip: If you navigated away from the **Jobs** page before running Puppet again, go to either the **Status** or **Jobs** page and click **Run** near the upper-right corner.

    # View and manage package inventory:

    1. To view and manage the complete inventory of packages on your systems, go to the **Packages** page.

    2. Search for packages: To narrow the list, enter the name or partial name of a package in the **Filter by package name** field and click **Apply**.

    4. Enter the following package names one at a time:
        **java-latest-openjdk**, **httpd**, **nginx**

    If a node is found with one of the above packages, you can now start to identify the node's role:

    | Package name        | Server role   |
    |---------------------|---------------|
    | java-latest-openjdk | App server    |
    | httpd               | Web server    |
    | nginx               | Load balancer |

    Congratulations! You ensured the visibility of all currently installed packages and versions.
